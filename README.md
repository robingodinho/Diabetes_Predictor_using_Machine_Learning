## Business Problem

Diabetes affects millions globally, presenting significant medical, social, and economic challenges. **Early detection is critical** for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. However, manual screening processes are resource-intensive and may miss at-risk individuals.

This project addresses the need for **automated, data-driven diabetes risk assessment** by:
- Reducing diagnostic costs through predictive screening
- Enabling early intervention for at-risk patients
- Supporting healthcare providers with evidence-based risk stratification
- Improving resource allocation in clinical settings

## Solution Approach

Using **machine learning and feature engineering**, this project delivers a practical solution for diabetes prediction. The approach combines:

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies the most relevant health indicators predictive of diabetes
- **Feature Selection**: Removes low-impact variables to improve model efficiency and interpretability
- **Logistic Regression**: Provides an interpretable, clinically-validated model for binary classification
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses multiple metrics to assess reliability across different patient populations

The workflow emphasizes **transparency and clinical applicability**, ensuring healthcare professionals can understand and trust the model's predictions.

## Project Features

- **Intelligent Feature Selection**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving predictive power
- **Data Standardization**: Ensures fair weighting of all health measurements
- **Visual Analytics**: Provides intuitive visualizations of risk factors by diabetes status
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
- **Reproducible Pipeline**: Complete workflow from raw data to deployment-ready model

## Technical Overview

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Core Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Data Source**: Pima Indians Diabetes Database
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression with StandardScaler preprocessing
- **Train-Test Split**: 80/20 ratio with random state 64

The project is organized as follows:
